# üìß Product-Specific Notification System - Testing & Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-04 17:05  
**Status:** ‚úÖ READY FOR TESTING

---

## üéØ What Was Fixed

### **Issue:** Product Display Showing ALL Products
The UI was displaying ALL products in the database instead of just the products assigned to the recipient.

**Root Cause:**
- The API endpoint `/api/admin/products?ids=xxx` wasn't filtering by IDs properly
- All products were being returned

**Solution:**
- Fetch all products (limit 1000)
- Filter client-side to match only `assigned_product_ids`
- Added clear visual styling (blue badges) for assigned products
- Added debugging logs to track filtering

---

## ‚úÖ How Email Notifications Work Now

### **Complete Flow for Product-Specific Recipients:**

```
1. Admin adds new recipient:
   Email: tuta@example.com
   Assigned Products: [Sony PlayStation 5]
   Categories: [] (disabled when products assigned)
   ‚Üì
2. Saved to database:
   notification_recipients table
   - email: 'tuta@example.com'
   - assigned_product_ids: ['product-id-123']
   - is_active: true
   ‚Üì
3. Customer orders PlayStation 5:
   Mobile money payment completed
   ‚Üì
4. Webhook processes payment:
   /api/payments/mobile/webhook
   ‚Üì
5. Extracts order items with product_id:
   itemsWithProductIds = [{
     product_id: 'product-id-123',
     name: 'Sony PlayStation 5',
     quantity: 1,
     price: '850000'
   }]
   ‚Üì
6. Calls notifyAdminOrderCreated with items:
   await notifyAdminOrderCreated({
     order_id,
     customer_email,
     customer_name,
     items: itemsWithProductIds  // ‚úÖ Includes product_id
   })
   ‚Üì
7. Notification service filters recipients:
   - Extracts product IDs from items: ['product-id-123']
   - Finds recipients with matching assigned_product_ids
   - Tuta matches! (has product-id-123 assigned)
   ‚Üì
8. Sends email to tuta@example.com ‚úÖ
   Subject: "New Order Created - [Order ID]"
   Content: Order details with products
```

## üîç Verification Steps

### **1. Check UI Display (Admin Dashboard)**

Go to: https://admin.tiscomarket.store/notifications

**For Each Recipient:**
- [ ] Product count badge shows correct number
- [ ] Product names displayed below badge (blue boxes)
- [ ] Only assigned products shown (not all products)
- [ ] Can hover/click to see full product names

### **2. Check Database**

```sql
-- Verify recipient is properly saved
SELECT 
  email,
  name,
  assigned_product_ids,
  is_active,
  created_at
FROM notification_recipients
WHERE email = 'tuta@example.com';

-- Should show:
-- assigned_product_ids: ['product-id-here']
-- is_active: true
```

### **3. Test Order Creation**

```bash
# Monitor Vercel logs in real-time
# Look for these messages:

üîç DEBUG: Order Product ID Extraction:
  extracted_product_ids: ['product-id-123']
  items_count: 1

üîç Product matching for tuta@example.com:
  recipient_products: ['product-id-123']
  order_products: ['product-id-123']
  has_match: true

‚úÖ Product-specific match: tuta@example.com assigned to products [product-id-123]

üìß Total unique recipients: 2
   (Tuta + General Admin)

‚úÖ Customer notification sent
‚úÖ Admin notifications sent
üìß Notifications completed successfully
```

### **4. Verify Email Delivery**

Within 1-2 minutes of order:
- [ ] Check tuta@example.com inbox
- [ ] Subject: "New Order Created" or similar
- [ ] Body contains order details
- [ ] Body shows product name
- [ ] Check spam folder if not in inbox

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Product names not showing in UI**

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify products still exist in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name FROM products 
   WHERE id IN ('product-id-1', 'product-id-2');
   ```
3. Clear cache and refresh page

---

### **Issue: Recipient not receiving emails**

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Verify recipient is active:**
   ```sql
   SELECT is_active FROM notification_recipients 
   WHERE email = 'tuta@example.com';
   -- Must be TRUE
   ```

2. **Check product IDs match exactly:**
   ```sql
   -- Get recipient's assigned products
   SELECT assigned_product_ids FROM notification_recipients 
   WHERE email = 'tuta@example.com';
   
   -- Get order's products
   SELECT product_id FROM order_items 
   WHERE order_id = 'your-order-id';
   
   -- IDs must match EXACTLY (case-sensitive UUIDs)
   ```

3. **Check Vercel logs for matching:**
   Look for: `‚úÖ Product-specific match: tuta@example.com`
   
   If you see: `‚ö™ No product assignment for tuta@example.com`
   ‚Üí Product IDs don't match or recipient not set up correctly

4. **Verify order contains assigned product:**
   The order MUST contain at least one of the assigned products

5. **Check SendPulse credentials:**
   ```bash
   # In Vercel Environment Variables:
   SENDPULSE_CLIENT_ID=xxx
   SENDPULSE_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
   SENDPULSE_SENDER_EMAIL=info@tiscomarket.store
   ```

---

### **Issue: Seeing "‚ö†Ô∏è No matching products found" in UI**

This means the `assigned_product_ids` contains invalid/deleted product IDs.

**Solution:**
1. Check which products are assigned:
   ```sql
   SELECT assigned_product_ids FROM notification_recipients 
   WHERE email = 'tuta@example.com';
   ```

2. Verify those products exist:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name FROM products 
   WHERE id = ANY(ARRAY['id-from-above']);
   ```

3. If products don't exist, reassign valid products in UI
