## 🔍 Post-Push Verification (1 minute)

### 1. Check GitHub
```bash
# Open in browser
xdg-open https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TISCO 2>/dev/null || open https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/TISCO
```
- ✅ Verify commit appears in repository
- ✅ Check GitHub Actions (if configured)

### 2. Check Vercel Dashboard
- Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Look for deployment status
- Should see "Building..." then "Ready"

### 3. Monitor Deployment Logs
- Click on the deployment in Vercel
- Watch build logs for any errors
- Should complete in 2-5 minutes

---

## 🌐 Post-Deployment Testing (5 minutes)

### Client App (tiscomarket.store)
```bash
# Test homepage
curl -I https://tiscomarket.store

# Check SSL certificate
curl -vI https://tiscomarket.store 2>&1 | grep -i "SSL\|certificate"
```

**Manual Browser Tests:**
1. ✅ Visit https://tiscomarket.store → Verify homepage loads
2. ✅ Click "Products" → Verify product list loads
3. ✅ Add item to cart → Verify cart updates
4. ✅ Open mobile view (F12 → Device Toolbar) → Test responsive design
5. ✅ Check browser console → Should be no critical errors

### Admin Dashboard (admin.tiscomarket.store)
```bash
# Test admin login page
curl -I https://admin.tiscomarket.store
```

**Manual Browser Tests:**
1. ✅ Visit https://admin.tiscomarket.store → Verify login page loads
2. ✅ Login with admin credentials → Verify dashboard appears
3. ✅ Navigate to Orders → Verify orders list loads
4. ✅ Check notifications page → Verify functionality
5. ✅ Test product management → Create/edit operations work

### API Endpoints
```bash
# Test health endpoint (if you have one)
curl https://tiscomarket.store/api/health

# Test products API
curl https://tiscomarket.store/api/products | jq '.' | head -20
```

## 🚨 If Issues Occur

### Build Fails in Vercel
1. Check Vercel build logs for error details
2. Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
3. Test build locally again: `npm run build`
4. If needed, rollback deployment in Vercel UI

### Environment Variables Missing
Go to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables

**Critical Variables to Verify:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
- `ZENOPAY_API_KEY`
- `SENDPULSE_SMTP_*` (all email variables)

### Domain Not Resolving
- DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours
- Test with Vercel preview URL first: `yourproject.vercel.app`
- Check DNS settings in domain registrar

### SSL Certificate Issues
- Vercel auto-provisions SSL certificates
- May take 5-10 minutes after domain setup
- Check Vercel → Domains → SSL Certificate status

---

## 📊 Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

### Vercel Dashboard
- Monitor function execution times
- Check error rates
- Review bandwidth usage
- Watch for rate limit errors

### Supabase Dashboard
- Database connections count
- Query performance metrics
- API request volume
- Storage usage

### Error Tracking
```bash
# Check Vercel function logs
# Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments → Your Deployment → Functions

# Look for:
# - 500 Internal Server Errors
# - Failed database connections
# - Payment webhook failures
# - Email delivery failures
```

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Deployment Successful When:
- ✅ Both builds complete without errors
- ✅ Homepage loads at https://tiscomarket.store
- ✅ Admin login works at https://admin.tiscomarket.store
- ✅ SSL certificates active (padlock icon in browser)
- ✅ No console errors on homepage
- ✅ Products load correctly
- ✅ Test order can be created
- ✅ Payment initiation works (test with small amount)

### Known Acceptable Warnings:
- Console logs in development/debugging code (normal for monitoring)
- TailwindCSS @custom-variant warnings (expected, valid syntax)
- Next.js 16 lint deprecation notice (non-critical)

---

## 📈 Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Metrics (from previous optimizations):
- **Homepage Load:** < 1 second (from 37.2kB → 6.83kB)
- **Time to Interactive:** < 2 seconds
- **Lighthouse Score:** 90+ (Performance, Accessibility, SEO)
- **Bundle Size:** 102 kB shared JS (optimized)

### Test After Deployment:
```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit
npx lighthouse https://tiscomarket.store --view
```

---

## 🔄 Rollback Procedure (If Needed)

### Option 1: Vercel UI Rollback
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
2. Find previous successful deployment
3. Click "..." menu → "Promote to Production"
4. Confirm rollback

### Option 2: Git Revert
```bash
# Find the last good commit
