# üîß Product-Specific Notification System - Complete Audit & Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-04 16:55  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED - Ready for Testing  
**Issue:** Product-specific recipients not receiving order notifications

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### **The Critical Bug**

The webhook was calling `notifyAdminOrderCreated()` but **NOT passing the items array with product IDs**:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (BROKEN)
await notifyAdminOrderCreated({
  order_id,
  customer_email,
  customer_name,
  total_amount,
  currency,
  payment_method,
  payment_status,
  items_count  // ‚ùå Only passing count, not actual items with product_ids!
})
```

**Why This Failed:**
1. The notification service expects `orderData.items` with `product_id` fields
2. It extracts product IDs from items to match against recipient assignments
3. Without items, the matching logic found **zero product IDs** in the order
4. Product-specific recipients were **skipped** because no products matched
5. Only category-based recipients (like "all") received notifications

---

## ‚úÖ Fixes Implemented

### **Fix #1: Pass Items with Product IDs to Notification Function**

**File:** `/client/app/api/payments/mobile/webhook/route.ts`

```typescript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
// Send admin notification with items for product-specific filtering
const itemsWithProductIds = (orderItems || []).map((item: any) => ({
  product_id: item.product_id || (item.products?.id),  // ‚úÖ Extract product_id
  name: item.products?.name || 'Product',
  quantity: item.quantity,
  price: item.price.toString()
}))

await notifyAdminOrderCreated({
  order_id,
  customer_email,
  customer_name,
  total_amount: session.amount.toString(),
  currency: session.currency,
  payment_method: 'Mobile Money',
  payment_status: 'paid',
  items_count,
  items: itemsWithProductIds  // ‚úÖ CRITICAL: Pass items with product_id
})
```

**Result:** The notification service now has product IDs to match against recipient assignments.

---

### **Fix #2: Enhanced Product Assignment UI**

**File:** `/admin/src/app/notifications/page.tsx`

**Added ProductAssignmentDisplay Component:**
- Shows which specific products are assigned to each recipient
- Fetches product names from database
- Displays in a clean, readable format
- Loading states for better UX

**Before:**
```
Tuta
francisjacob@tuta.email
[1 product]  ‚Üê Just a count, can't see which product!
```

**After:**
```
Tuta
francisjacob@tuta.email
[1 product]
‚îî‚îÄ Sony PlayStation 5  ‚Üê Now shows actual product name!
```

## üéØ How Product-Specific Notifications Work

### **The Filtering Logic** (from `/client/lib/notifications/service.ts`)

```typescript
// Step 1: Extract product IDs from order items
const orderProductIds = [
  ...(orderData.items?.map(item => item.product_id).filter(Boolean) || [])
]

// Step 2: Find recipients with matching product assignments
const productSpecificRecipients = recipients.filter(recipient => {
  if (!recipient.assigned_product_ids || recipient.assigned_product_ids.length === 0) {
    return false  // No product assignments
  }
  
  const hasMatchingProduct = orderProductIds.some(productId => 
    recipient.assigned_product_ids?.includes(productId)
  )
  
  return hasMatchingProduct
})

// Step 3: ADDITIVE strategy - combine product-specific + general recipients
const categoryBasedRecipients = recipients.filter(recipient => {
  if (recipient.assigned_product_ids && recipient.assigned_product_ids.length > 0) {
    return false  // Skip - already handled by product filtering
  }
  
  const categories = recipient.notification_categories || ['all']
  return categories.includes('all') || 
         categories.some(cat => ['order_created', 'orders'].includes(cat))
})

// Final list: product-specific + category-based recipients
const allEligibleRecipients = [
  ...productSpecificRecipients,
  ...categoryBasedRecipients
]
```

**ADDITIVE Strategy:**
- Product-specific recipients get notified when their products are in the order
- General recipients (with "all" or "orders" categories) always get notified
- Both groups receive notifications (not exclusive)

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### **Scenario 1: Product-Specific Recipient**

**Setup:**
1. Add recipient "Tuta" with email: `francisjacob@tuta.email`
2. Assign product: "Sony PlayStation 5" (ID: `abc123`)
3. Set categories: Empty (product filter active)

**Test:**
1. Create order with PlayStation 5
2. Complete mobile money payment
3. **Expected:** Tuta receives email notification ‚úÖ
4. Check logs for: `‚úÖ Product-specific match: francisjacob@tuta.email`

**Negative Test:**
1. Create order with different product (e.g., "iPhone 15")
2. Complete payment
3. **Expected:** Tuta does NOT receive notification (correct)
4. Other admins with "all" category still receive notification

---

### **Scenario 2: Multiple Products Assigned**

**Setup:**
1. Add recipient with 3 products: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch
2. Set categories: Empty

**Test:**
1. Order with PlayStation 5 ‚Üí ‚úÖ Notified
2. Order with Xbox Series X ‚Üí ‚úÖ Notified
3. Order with iPhone 15 ‚Üí ‚ùå Not notified (correct)
4. Order with PlayStation 5 + iPhone 15 ‚Üí ‚úÖ Notified (contains assigned product)

---

### **Scenario 3: General Recipient (All Categories)**

**Setup:**
1. Add recipient "Admin" 
2. Set categories: "All Events"
3. No product assignments

**Test:**
1. Order with any product ‚Üí ‚úÖ Always notified
2. This is the fallback admin who gets everything

---

## üìä Verification Checklist

### **After Deployment:**

**1. Check Vercel Logs:**
```
Look for these log messages:

üîç DEBUG: Order Product ID Extraction:
  extracted_product_ids: ['abc123', 'def456']  ‚Üê Should show actual IDs
  items_count: 2

üîç Product matching for francisjacob@tuta.email:
  recipient_products: ['abc123']
  order_products: ['abc123', 'def456']
  has_match: true

‚úÖ Product-specific match: francisjacob@tuta.email assigned to products [abc123]

üìä ADDITIVE FILTERING RESULTS:
   üéØ Product-specific recipients: 1
   üìÇ Category-based recipients: 2
   üìß Total unique recipients: 3
```

**2. Check Admin UI:**
- Go to Admin ‚Üí Notifications ‚Üí Recipients
- Find recipient with product assignment
- Verify product names are displayed (not just count)
- Should show: "Sony PlayStation 5" or whatever product was assigned

**3. Test Real Order:**
- Place order with assigned product
- Product-specific recipient should receive email
- Check spam folder if not in inbox
- Verify email contains correct order details

**4. Check Database:**
```sql
-- Verify notification was sent to product-specific recipient
SELECT 
  nr.email,
  nr.assigned_product_ids,
  nl.event,
  nl.created_at
FROM notification_recipients nr
LEFT JOIN notification_logs nl ON nl.recipient_email = nr.email
WHERE nr.assigned_product_ids IS NOT NULL
  AND nl.created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY nl.created_at DESC;
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: Product-specific recipient still not getting emails**

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check Vercel logs for product ID extraction:
   ```
   üîç DEBUG: Order Product ID Extraction:
     extracted_product_ids: [...]
   ```
   - If empty array, items aren't being passed correctly
   - If has IDs, check if they match recipient assignment

2. Verify product assignment in database:
   ```sql
   SELECT email, assigned_product_ids 
   FROM notification_recipients 
   WHERE email = 'francisjacob@tuta.email';
   ```
   - Ensure `assigned_product_ids` contains correct product ID
   - IDs must match exactly (case-sensitive)

3. Check if order contains assigned product:
   ```sql
   SELECT oi.product_id, p.name
   FROM order_items oi
   JOIN products p ON p.id = oi.product_id
   WHERE oi.order_id = 'your-order-id';
   ```

4. Verify recipient is active:
   ```sql
   SELECT email, is_active FROM notification_recipients;
   ```
   - Must be `is_active = true`

---

### **Issue: Product names not showing in admin UI**

**Solution:**
The `ProductAssignmentDisplay` component fetches products by IDs. Verify:

1. API endpoint works:
   ```bash
   curl 'https://admin.tiscomarket.store/api/admin/products?ids=abc123,def456'
   ```

2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify product IDs are valid (products still exist in database)

---

### **Issue: Can't add multiple products**

**Solution:**
The `ProductMultiSelect` component already supports multiple products:
- Click the search field
- Search for product
- Click to select (adds to list)
- Search for another product
- Click to select (adds to list)
- Can select unlimited products
- Use X button to remove products from selection

---

## üìà Expected Behavior

### **Product Assignment Rules:**

1. **When products are assigned:**
   - Category filters are disabled
   - Recipient only gets notifications for assigned products
   - Works with mobile money orders ‚úÖ
   - Works with "pay at office" orders ‚úÖ

2. **When no products assigned:**
   - Category filters are active
   - Recipient gets notifications based on selected categories
   - "All Events" means all notifications
   - Specific categories filter accordingly

3. **Multiple recipients:**
   - Product-specific recipients get matched orders
   - General recipients get all orders
   - No duplicates sent
   - ADDITIVE strategy (both groups notified)

---

**Fixed Issues:**
1. ‚úÖ Webhook now passes items with product_id to notification function
2. ‚úÖ Product-specific filtering now works for mobile money orders
3. ‚úÖ Admin UI shows which products are assigned to recipients
