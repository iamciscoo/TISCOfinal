**Status:** ✅ FULLY DEPLOYED - Production Ready  
**Issues Fixed:** 2 Critical Issues

---

## 🎯 Summary

Fixed product-specific email notifications for mobile payments AND added full edit functionality for managing recipient product assignments in the admin UI.

---

## 🐛 Issue #1: Mobile Payments Not Sending Product-Specific Emails

### **Problem:**
Recipients with assigned products (like "Tuta" with PlayStation 5) were NOT receiving email notifications when customers ordered those products via mobile money.

### **Root Cause:**
The webhook query was missing the `product_id` field:

```typescript
// BROKEN - product_id not selected
const { data: orderItems } = await supabase
  .from('order_items')
  .select(`
    quantity,
    price,
    products (name)
  `)
```

**Result:** `item.product_id` was `undefined`, product matching failed, no emails sent.

### **Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// FIXED - product_id now selected
const { data: orderItems } = await supabase
  .from('order_items')
  .select(`
    product_id,         // ✅ Now included
    quantity,
    price,
    products (
      id,               // ✅ Fallback
      name
    )
  `)

// Added debug logging
console.log(`🔍 Order items query result:`, {
  items: orderItems?.map(item => ({
    product_id: item.product_id,  // ✅ Available
    name: item.products?.name
  }))
})
```

## 🛠️ Issue #2: No Way to Edit Recipients or Manage Products

### **Problem:**
- Once a recipient was added, you couldn't edit them
- Couldn't add more products to existing recipients
- Couldn't remove products from recipients
- Had to delete and re-create to make changes

### **Fix Applied:**

Added full edit functionality:

**1. Edit Button:**
```tsx
<Button onClick={() => {
  setNewRecipient({
    email: r.email,
    name: r.name || '',
    assigned_product_ids: r.assigned_product_ids || []
  })
  setIsEditing(true)
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })
  toast.info(`Editing ${r.name}. You can now add/remove products.`)
}}>
  Edit
</Button>
```

**2. Dynamic Button:**
```tsx
<Button disabled={!newRecipient.email}>
  {isEditing ? 'Update Recipient' : 'Add Recipient'}
</Button>
```

**3. Cancel Button:**
```tsx
{isEditing && (
  <Button variant="outline" onClick={() => {
    setNewRecipient({ email: '', ... })
    setIsEditing(false)
    toast.info('Edit cancelled')
  }}>
    Cancel Edit
  </Button>
)}
```

**File:** `/admin/src/app/notifications/page.tsx`

## 📧 Complete Email Flow

### **Example: Tuta with PlayStation 5**

**Setup:**
```
Recipient: Tuta
Email: francisjacob@tuta.email
Assigned Products: [PlayStation 5]
```

**Scenario 1: Customer Orders PlayStation 5**
```
1. Customer adds PS5 to cart
2. Completes mobile money payment
   ↓
3. Webhook receives payment notification
   ↓
4. Queries order_items with product_id ✅
   product_id: 'abc-123' (PS5 ID)
   ↓
5. Passes to notifyAdminOrderCreated:
   items: [{ product_id: 'abc-123', name: 'PlayStation 5' }]
   ↓
6. Notification service extracts:
   orderProductIds = ['abc-123']
   ↓
7. Finds matching recipients:
   Tuta has assigned_product_ids: ['abc-123']
   ✅ MATCH!
   ↓
8. Sends email to francisjacob@tuta.email ✅
```

**Scenario 2: Customer Orders iPhone**
```
1. Customer orders iPhone (product_id: 'xyz-789')
   ↓
2. Webhook extracts: orderProductIds = ['xyz-789']
   ↓
3. Checks Tuta's assignments: ['abc-123']
   ❌ NO MATCH
   ↓
4. Tuta does NOT receive email (correct) ✅
5. General admins (with "all") still get email ✅
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: Recipient not receiving emails**

**Debug Steps:**

1. **Check Vercel Logs:**
   ```
   Look for:
   🔍 Order items query result:
     product_id: 'actual-id-here'  // Must not be null/undefined
   
   🔍 Product matching for [email]:
     has_match: true               // Must be true
   
   ✅ Product-specific match: [email]
   ```

2. **Verify Product IDs Match:**
   ```sql
   -- Recipient's products
   SELECT assigned_product_ids 
   FROM notification_recipients 
   WHERE email = 'tuta@example.com';
   -- Result: ['abc-123']
   
   -- Order's products
   SELECT product_id 
   FROM order_items 
   WHERE order_id = 'order-id';
   -- Result: 'abc-123'
   
   -- IDs must match EXACTLY
   ```

3. **Check Recipient is Active:**
   ```sql
   SELECT is_active FROM notification_recipients 
   WHERE email = 'tuta@example.com';
   -- Must be: true
   ```

### **Issue: Edit button not working**

1. Clear browser cache
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify admin UI deployed successfully

---

### **Issue: Can't see product names**

1. Refresh the page
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify products exist in database:

   SELECT id, name FROM products 
   WHERE id = 'product-id-here';
   ```
